What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Git keeps a hidden .git folder with meta-data about the repository. When you initialize a
    repository git creates this directory and sets up the initial metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you
think it offers?

    Your working directory is an actual directory containing the files in your project. The staging
    area is a list of files from your working directory you are planning to include in your next
    commit. By distinguishing these it is possible to not commit all changed files in a single
    commit, but split them up into separate logical wholes.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    You can use git diff and git diff --staging to have a look at which changes you are about to
    commit and which ones you are leaving out. This allows you to make sure the combination of
    changes adds up to a logical whole.
