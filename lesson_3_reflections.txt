When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Using a remote repository gives you a place in the cloud to sync changes between computers or
    co-workers. It also functions as a useful backup of your code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If git automatically pulled changes from the remote there is a risk that it ended up pulling
    while you were in the middle of doing changes on head. This could lead to conflicts between
    what you were doing and the code pulled by git.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?

    I would use fork when I wanted my own version of a existing project on Github. I would use clone
    to get a local copy of a repository on GitHub. I would use branches to manage different
    collections of commits in my repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    That way you can work on making changes to the last remote state even if you do not have
    internet access.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be
harder?

    Would probably use something like google docs. It would automatically, constantly merge changes
    and you could see what changes are made. You would not be able to use a proper text editor and
    you would not have a nice logical history of commits. Nor would you have the ability to do pull
    requests.
