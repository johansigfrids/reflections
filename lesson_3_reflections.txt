When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Using a remote repository gives you a place in the cloud to sync changes between computers or
    co-workers. It also functions as a useful backup of your code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If git automatically pulled changes from the remote there is a risk that it ended up pulling
    while you were in the middle of doing changes on head. This could lead to conflicts between
    what you were doing and the code pulled by git.
